# Expense Tracker

Hello! This project is an expense tracker that's simple and user friendly. This is mostly targeted at students
who wants to keep track of their daily expenses and savings, but anyone can use this application. As of now,
this is just a simple group project that aims for us to learn more about coding. We hope this application may
be found useful.
